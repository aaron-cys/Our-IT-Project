            <h2 class="mb-4">Comparison</h2>
            <p>Within the group, there is a variety of Ideal jobs from each of the group members, from software engineers to developers, digital designers and cloud engineers all with a different specialisation. Between these jobs there are common aspects included in the job, such as being required to be able to write programs in a certain language, to being creative on the job, problem solving and communication with others to complete a project proposition. However, although they may have many commonalities, there are also many differences. For examples the position of a digital designer, they would require to be much more creative than the other position and specialise in using programs to assist them with their ideas such as Adobe photoshop. In contrast to this, the position of a software engineer and or a program developer, they would be required to have a specialisation in a programming language in order to create programs or to be specialised in it, so they are able to debug problems within a program. In the group, our career plans are not too fat apart as majority of us are planning to get into the position where we would be required to develop of create something in either design or in a software perspective.</p>
